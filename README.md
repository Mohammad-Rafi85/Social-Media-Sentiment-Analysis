# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

The Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset by Kashish Parmar, available on Kaggle, is a labeled collection of social media posts designed for sentiment analysis tasks. It contains two main columns: text, which includes user-generated posts from platforms like Twitter or Facebook, and sentiment, which labels each post as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. This dataset is well-suited for Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects such as text classification, opinion mining, and brand sentiment tracking. It is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and ideal for training machine learning models or building real-time sentiment prediction systems. With its balanced and ready-to-use format, it serves as an excellent resource for academic, research, or portfolio-building purposes.
